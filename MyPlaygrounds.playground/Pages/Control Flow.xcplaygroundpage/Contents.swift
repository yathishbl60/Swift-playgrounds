// *** Switch

/*
 1. No implicit fallthrough : entire switch statement finishes its execution as soon as the first matching switch case is completed , So break statment is not required
 
 2. The body of each case must contain atleast one executable statement
 i.e
 case "a":
 case "A":print("A")
 is Invalid
 
 3. Multiple matches for a single switch case can be separated by comma
 i.e
 case "a", "A": print("A")
